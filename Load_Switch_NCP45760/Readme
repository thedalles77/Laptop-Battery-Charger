I had problems getting this NCP45760IMN24RTWG load switch to work but I'll provide the information in case someone else has better luck. 
Let me know if you find a way to make it work.
The Eagle board and schematic files are provided along with pictures.
The 3.3 volt regulator can be an AP7381-33V-A through hole or the AP7381-33Y-13 SMD. The caps are 0805 case size and the resistors are 0603 size.
The loads on the switch were two LM2596 buck regulators that provided 10 volts to the video card and 5 volts to the Pi. 
Each buck regulator had a 100uf cap on its input and a 220uf cap on its output with more caps on the Pi and video card.
The input voltage was 19 Volts DC from a wall supply.
I started with the overcurrent resistor R2 set at 10K and the slew rate capacitor C4 set to 0.01uf but this caused the current protection circuit to trip when first enabled.
Changing the R2 resistor to a short did not change anything but changing the C4 slew rate cap to 1uf allowed the switch to work without tripping the protection circuit.
It ran for 30 minutes and the temperature on the chip and input/output traces stabilized at 52 deg C.
Unfortuantely the load switch would not turn off so I apparently ruined the chip by setting the slew rate to a very slow value.
Even changing the slew rate cap to 0.1uf will still exceed the Energy rating based on the formulas in the data sheet.
This leads me to believe that this chip is not usable for my configuration but it may work fine at lower voltages and/or lower currents.
